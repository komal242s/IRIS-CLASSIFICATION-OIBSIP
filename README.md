1-Data-science Task
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION TASK

This repository contains code for predicting the class of Iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this task is avialable attached below .

Dependencies The code is written in Python 3.9 and requires the following libraries:

pandas numpy scikit-learn Flask Usage To use the Flask application, follow these steps:

Step 1 : Collect the Data Download the Iris dataset from the Repository. Save the dataset in a folder called 'data' in the root directory of the repository.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis Load the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy. Explore the dataset using visualizations, statistical measures, and other methods. Document your findings in a Jupyter notebook called 'Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb' in a folder called 'notebooks'.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Scale the numerical features using StandardScaler or any other scaling technique. Convert the categorical variable into numerical format. Save the preprocessed data in a folder called 'processed_data' in the root directory of the repository. Step 4: Model Development Develop a classification model using a suitable algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Train the model on the training data. Test the model on the testing data and evaluate the performance using appropriate metrics. Save the trained model as a pickle file in a folder called 'models' in the root directory of the repository.
